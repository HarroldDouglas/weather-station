# Frontend task
Thank you for taking the time to complete the technical task for the Frontend developer position at Mad
Duck Code.

Aiming to give you a chance to demonstrate your skills and practices with the level of complexity you’re
capable of, we’ve designed this test with flexibility in mind. This is an opportunity to showcase your
knowledge of OOP and SOLID principles, design patterns and tests, and display any tricks you’ve got up
your sleeve. This is a test for all levels, so no need to stress in case you’d prefer to stick to the basics.
Regardless of how you choose to approach the task, we recommend you stick to demonstrating your
coding skills and practices aligned with the technologies to be used for the position you’re applying for.

# Instructions
Get the code up on Git and use it during development. Commit your work in smaller
increments - when switching between tasks or at the end of the day, so we can get a better idea of your
approach. Don’t worry about the functionality of the code with each commitment, instead have it
functional when you’ve completed the task. When delivering, please send the link to the Repository
and supply all source code as well.

The deadline to complete this task is 7 days. We want to give you an opportunity to think about the task
and create a solution you’re satisfied with - through clean high-quality code! If you happen to complete
the task before the deadline, don’t hesitate to send it in - the sooner you complete it, the sooner we can
get back to you about the next step.

# Task description
Create an application that shows the weather in different cities. Going to the homepage
for the first time, the user should choose 5 cities they want to track weather for. Cards are created
for each of the cities, containing the city’s name and current temperature below the name. The cities
entered should be stored in local storage so they would be saved even when the user refreshes the page.
Each card should be clickable and when the user clicks on the card they should be directed to a single city
page.

The single city page should contain information about the city at the top of the page (name, region,
country, lat, long, etc). Information details about the current temperature should be shown below the
information details of the city.
Below the current temperature details, the weather forecast section should be shown. The forecast
should be shown hourly and should cover the next 3 days.
All pages should be responsive.
